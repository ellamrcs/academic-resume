# abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a non-invasive medical diagnostic tool
#   that has raised public concerns due to the associated health risks of radiation
#   dose to patients. Reducing the radiation dose leads to noise artifacts, making the
#   low-dose CT images unreliable for diagnosis. Hence, low-dose CT (LDCT) image reconstruction
#   techniques have offered a new research area. In this study, a deep neural network
#   is proposed, specifically a residual network (ResNet) using dilated convolution,
#   batch normalization, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) layers with fused spatial-
#   and channel-attention modules to enhance the quality of LDCT images. The network
#   is optimized using the integration of per-pixel loss, perceptual loss via VGG16-net,
#   and dissimilarity index loss. Through an ablation experiment, these functions show
#   that they could effectively prevent edge oversmoothing, improve image texture, and
#   preserve the structural details. Finally, comparative experiments showed that the
#   qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed network outperform state-of-the-art
#   denoising models such as block-matching 3D filtering (BM3D), Markovian-based patch
#   generative adversarial network (patch-GAN), and dilated residual network with edge
#   detection (DRL-E-MP).
